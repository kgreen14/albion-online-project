# PROJECT 3 - ALBION ONLINE BUILDS - AO BUILDS

## APP OBJECTIVE: 
This app, titled AO Builds is designed to allow a user to create a "build" in the PC game Albion Online. A build is a set of items that define a character's role in game and what specific items/abilities that character can use. The goal is to give the AO community a place to theory craft and share their best or craziest builds. Users will be able to vote on builds, which will then push those builds to the top of the build list for others to find.
